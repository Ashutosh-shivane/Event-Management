# 🍅 EventMentor

## 🎯 Project Objective
EventMentor is an all-in-one web platform where **students, vendors, event managers, and organizers** collaborate to execute events efficiently. The platform enables students to earn through gigs, vendors to supply services transparently, and organizers to manage events — directly or via event managers — with secure payments and performance ratings.

## 🚧 Key Problems Solved

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|

| Organizers overwhelmed by managing multiple vendors | Event Manager role to take complete event responsibility |
| Payment frauds & disputes | Escrow-based wallet system with secure digital contracts |
| Lack of transparency in vendor/student performance | Rating & review system accessible only to verified participants |
